# READ FIRST — How to Use These Docs

**Goal:** Get a working Hytopia project skeleton fast, with a clear design and implementation path.

## Step 1: Generate the Project Files
- Open **Scaffold-Prompt.md**
- Copy the entire code block
- Paste into Cursor or Claude Code
- Run its “apply all files” (or equivalent) so it writes the file tree to `/game`

## Step 2: Run the Demo
From the `/game` folder generated by the scaffold:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Step 3: Start Implementing
Use **Implementation-Roadmap.md** to:  
- Wire `// TODO: HytopiaAPI` bindings (env lighting, spawning, audio, storage, marketplace)  
- Fill out JSON data (items, recipes, enemies, waves, runes, zones)  
- Iterate on the AI, Night Director, and Crafting systems

## Step 4: Keep Design in Sync
Use **GDD-99-Nights.md** as your single source of truth for tone, scope, enemies, and content cadence.
